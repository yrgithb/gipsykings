Gipsy Combat
============

Two-player versus game for PC. Core gameplay: one boulder is available, which takes 0.7 seconds to pick up. After it is picked up, the player can throw it, killing the opposing player upon impact.
Once the boulder has been picked up, the player not wielding the boulder  can pick up a pebble. It is is thrown at the player wielding the boulder fast, interrupting any throw charging he is doing and causing him to drop the boulder.
Physics big part of gameplay, defining the feeling of picking up and throwing the boulder, also impact.

Core gameplay influencers:

- boulder pick-up and charge timers
- boulder physics
- pebble counter-play
- player mobility (i.e. via double jump or roll/air roll)
- level design

Roadmap:
========

PreAlpha (2 weeks from project start)

- Simple rectangular arena
- x and y axis movement
- jumping
- One player
- Boulder, picking up and throwing the boulder
- basic ui
- programmer art

Alpha (4 weeks from project start)

- two players
- double jump or roll mechanic
- pebble implementation
- placeholder art & improved ui (health bars, etc(
- basic impact
- death & respawn

Beta 

- advanced throwing (trajectories, force, charge finetuning)
- advanced impact (ragdoll physics, dismembering)
- better art
- biomes
- basic level design (multi level arena with platforms etc)

Final

- rocksize variations with included physics implication
- music and sounds
- final art
- final level design
- final biome count, generation

Review

- define overall future
- discuss game quality
- discuss sales feasibility
