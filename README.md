Boulderados
============

Two-player versus game for PC. Core gameplay: one boulder is available, which takes 0.7 seconds to pick up. After it is picked up, the player can throw it, killing the opposing player upon impact.
Once the boulder has been picked up, the player not wielding the boulder  can pick up a pebble. It is is thrown at the player wielding the boulder fast, interrupting any throw charging he is doing and causing him to drop the boulder.
Physics big part of gameplay, defining the feeling of picking up and throwing the boulder, also impact.

Defining the gameplay:

- boulder pick-up and charge timers (influenced by biome type)
- boulder physics
- boulders provide different skills/perks
- player mobility (i.e. via double jump/air jump and roll/air roll and combo of both)
- level design (3-heights levels in different biomes)
- if the throwing player is higher than the player being thrown at, the boulder will be influenced by gravity and fall faster and do more damage
- detailed animations
